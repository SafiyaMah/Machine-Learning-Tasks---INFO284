## Project Overview
This repository contains the work for the INFO284 Group Exam in Spring 2023. The tasks involve building machine learning models to analyze and classify different data sets, using Python in a Jupyter notebook format. Below are the details of each task:

### Task 1: Mushroom Edibility Prediction
- **Objective**: Build at least 3 machine learning models to predict mushroom edibility using the [UCI Mushroom dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom).
- **Steps**:
  - Data pre-processing and feature selection.
  - Model building (e.g., decision trees, random forest, logistic regression).
  - Evaluation of models and discussion of performance.
  - Identification of key features influencing edibility.
  
### Task 2: Sentiment Analysis
- **Objective**: Classify sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) of sentences from the [NoReC Sentence dataset](https://github.com/ltgoslo/norec_sentence).
- **Steps**:
  - Text preprocessing and feature engineering.
  - Model building (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, neural networks).
  - Evaluation of model performance and discussion.

### Task 3: Convolutional Neural Networks
- **Objective**: Train a binary classifier using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
- **Steps**:
  - Data preprocessing and selection of target category.
  - Use of pre-trained CNN (or own CNN if computational power allows).
  - Testing the model on a new image of the chosen category.

## Prerequisites

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (for CNN task)
- `matplotlib`
- `nltk` (for Sentiment Analysis)
